# Hydraulic Modelling Toolkit for District Heating (Python)
An open-source Python package for steady-state hydraulic modelling of district heating (DH) networks. The toolkit builds incidence and loop matrices using graph theory and solves mass and energy balances through Newtonâ€“Raphson (NR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods. It provides a transparent and reproducible framework for researchers and practitioners to analyse flow and pressure distributions in central hydronic networks of any scale.

## Methodology
District Heating networks are central hydronic systems that distribute thermal energy via supply and return pipelines. Hydraulic modelling is critical to ensure adequate pressure and flow at all substations, evaluate network extensions, integrate new heat sources, and support efficient operation. 

This toolkit is based on the methodology described in the reference given below, its key principles being:
